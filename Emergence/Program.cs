    // In this example, we have a simple implementation of a shopping cart system. The  ShoppingCart  class represents a shopping cart and allows products to be added to it.
    // The  CalculateTotal  method calculates the total price of all the products in the cart. 

    // The design of the  ShoppingCart class emerges gradually as new requirements arise.
    // Initially, it starts with a basic structure, and additional features or functionalities can be added incrementally as needed.
    // This approach allows for flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements during the software development process.

    // The example demonstrates how emergent design can lead to a flexible and evolving software system.
    // As new features or requirements emerge, the design can be adjusted and extended to accommodate them, resulting in a more robust and adaptable solution.
