    // In this example, we have a  Counter  class that maintains a count and provides a thread-safe  Increment  method using the  Interlocked.Increment  method.
    // The  ConcurrentCodeExample  class demonstrates concurrent code by starting multiple threads to increment the counter concurrently. 
    
    // The example showcases the challenges and best practices for writing clean and efficient concurrent code:  
    // Challenge: Race Conditions - The Interlocked.Increment  method is used to ensure atomicity and avoid race conditions when multiple threads access and modify the count  variable simultaneously. 
    // Best Practice: Thread Safety - The Counter  class is designed to be thread-safe, allowing multiple threads to safely increment the count without unexpected behavior. 
    // Best Practice: Synchronization - The use of Thread.Join  ensures that the main thread waits for all the worker threads to complete before printing the final count. 
    // Best Practice: Atomic Operations - The Interlocked.Increment method provides an atomic increment operation, avoiding the need for explicit locks and reducing contention.
    
    // By following these best practices, you can write clean and efficient concurrent code that avoids race conditions, ensures thread safety, and maximizes performance.
