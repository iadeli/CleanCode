        public bool IsAdult()
        {
            return Age >= 18;
        }
    }

    // In this example, we have a  Customer  class that represents a customer with properties for their first name, last name, and age.
    // The class also has methods to get the customer's full name and determine if they are an adult. 

    // Over time, as part of the successive refinement process, improvements can be made to enhance the code.
    // For example, we can introduce constructor overloading to set the properties during object creation, encapsulate the properties with private setters, and use auto-implemented properties for brevity.
    // Additionally, we can incorporate validation or error handling logic as needed.

    // By continuously refining and improving the code in small iterations, we can enhance its structure, readability, maintainability, and performance.
    // This iterative process helps create more robust and maintainable software systems.
