            return true;
        }
    }

    // In this example, we have a payment service that interacts with a payment gateway through an interface called  IPaymentGateway . The  PaymentService  class depends on an instance of  IPaymentGateway  to process payments. 
    // The PaymentService  class has a method called MakePayment  that performs some business logic and then calls the ProcessPayment  method on the payment gateway.Based on the payment status returned by the gateway, the service performs additional actions.
    // The PayPalGateway  class is an implementation of the  IPaymentGateway interface, representing a specific payment gateway(in this case, PayPal). It provides the implementation for the ProcessPayment  method.

    // By using interfaces and well-defined boundaries, the components can interact with each other through the defined contract, allowing for flexibility, modularity, and easy swapping of different implementations of the payment gateway.
